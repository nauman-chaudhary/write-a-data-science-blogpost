### Project Motivation

This project is part of Udacity Data Science Nano Degree Program.

I used historical Olympics Dataset for this project. It can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results).

This project focuses on answering following questions:

- *What is the most participated event in Olympics?*
- *Which country has won most GOLD medals?*
- *What is the distribution of height over time for both genders?*

### Libraries

Here are the main libraries used for the project:

1. Pandas
2. Seaborn
3. Matplotlib

### File Descriptions

1. `notebook.ipynb` contains the code for data reading, wrangling, exploration and visualizations.
2. `athlete_events.csv` is the main data source for the project, which contains information about athletes participating in Olympics.
3. `noc_regions.csv` contains information about the NOCs associated with different countries.
